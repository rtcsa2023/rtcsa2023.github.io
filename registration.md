- <span style="color: red; "> One registration covers only one paper.</span>  
- The proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore. All authors who have been accepted must register for the symposium and attend the symposium to present their paper. Authors who do not attend the symposium to present their papers, or arrange for a co-author or knowledgeable colleague to present their paper in the absence of the primary author, will not have their paper published in the IEEE Xplore, per IEEE policy. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a submission from distribution after the symposium, including exclusion from IEEE Xplore, if the submission does not meet IEEE standards for scope and/or quality. Articles excluded from further distribution shall be archived by IEEE but shall not be indexed or appear on IEEE Xplore.
- Please take note that IEEE has a strict policy on No-Show. Therefore, if your paper is accepted, one of the authors and their representatives MUST PRESENT their paper at the symposium. Papers with NO SHOW participants will not be submitted to IEEE Xplore. No refund of the paid fees may be claimed by the NO SHOW author.
